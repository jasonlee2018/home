		be a fun fighting game fought amongst Nintendo's most iconic <a href="#SSBCHAR">characters</a>, 
		the series garnered widespread success. Along with versus mode, which the game is known for, the 
		game also features an adventure mode. In adventure mode players fought went through a series of 
		fights, in pre-determined order. The level of difficulty could be changed. Along with

		<h3>Competetive Community</h3>
		<p>The Original smash bros. has a fairly small, but dedicated community of veterans, being the 
		second to last game in terms of popularity. Most N64 players also play other Smash games as well.

		<img src="Images/SSBM.jpg" width="900" height="400" alt="Picture of the cast of Super Smash Bros

		<p>Due to the success of Super Smash Bros. Nintendo decided to create a sequel. This time around
		they decided to not only bring back extremely iconic characters, they decided to add in 
		<a href="#SSBMCHAR">characters</a> for more obscure games at the time, such as Marth and Roy for 
		Fire Emblem which was at that time a japanese exclusive title. In this game a tournament was added
		in order to be able to set up tournaments on the system, as well as an adventure mode,among many 
		other game modes. </p>

		<h3>Competetive Community</h3>
		<p>Super Smash Bros. Melee is the most popular Smash game in the franchise. It has an amazing, and
		thriving community, that's still growing to this day. It's considered the big brother of Smash,
		because it was because of the efforts of the Melee community that Smash is considered to be part
		of the FGC(fighting game community). In fact some members of the dedicated community put together
		a documentary to show the development of melee as an esport. The game is still played competetively
		to this day, and still stands as one of the fighting game titans.</p>

		title screen"/>
		<p>After the incredible success of Super Smash Bros. Melee, Nintendo decided to once again 
		create another smash game. Due to their bigger budget, and longer development time many
		more stages, and characters were added. Moreover a storymode was added the game, which is
		something unique to only Brawl. </p>

		Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Link, Zelda/Sheik, Ganandorf, Samus, Kirby, Fox,

		<img src="Images/CS3.jpg" width="900" height="400" alt="Picture of character select screen in

		<h3>Stages</h3>
		<p>This game has a total of 41 stages. Out of those stages only 10 of those stages are legal. The

		</ul>
		<h3>Competetive Community</h3>
		<p>Super Smash Bros Brawl has the smallest community out of all the smash communities. This is because
		of how they removed many of the advancded techniques that made melee special, and added more randomness
		to the game, with tripping. Tripping was completely random, and the effects it had when you did trip
		were devestating, in the worst case losing you the game. Moreover the game was slowed down 
		drastically, killing the game for melee pro players. Despite this, there is still a group of 
		dedicated community brawl players. However most have moved onto Smash 4.</p>
		<h2 id="SSB4">Smash 4</h2>
		<img src="Images/SSB4.jpg" width="900" height="400" alt="Image of poster of
		super smash bros 4"/> 
		<p>With the disappointment of brawl, and a 4 year development, Nintendo had big expectations to meet.
		Luckily they met every single one of them with Smash 4. Along with the overall speed increase to the
		game a master hand, and crazy hand mode were added. These were basically mismashes of brawl's story 
		mode, and adventure mode.</p>
		<h3>Characters</h3>
		<p>Super Smash Bros. 4 brought back many old favourites, while adding many more to the mix. The 
		returning cast of characters were Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Dr.Mario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Diddy 
		Kong, Link, Zelda, Sheik, Ganondorf, Toon Link, Samus, Zero Suit Samus, Kirby, Meta Knight, King
		Dedede, Fox, Falco, Pikachu, Jigglypuff, Mewtwo(DLC),Lucario, Charizard, Captain Falcon, Ness, 
		Lucas(DLC), Marth, Roy(DLC), Ike, Mr.Game & Watch, Pit, Wario, Olimar, R.O.B, and Sonic. The 
		newcomers were Rosalina & Luma, Bowser Jr, Greninja, Robin, Lucina, Corrin(DLC) Palutena, Dark Pit,
		Villager, Little Mac, Wii Fit Trainer, Shulk, Duck Hunt, Megaman, Pac Man, Ryu(DLC), Cloud(DLC),
		Bayonetta(DLC), and the customizable Mii fighters.</p>
		<img src="Images/CS4.jpg" width="900" height="400" alt="Image of character select screen in 
		super smash bros 4"/> 
		<h2>Stages</h2>
		<p>This game has a total of 55 stages. Out of those Stages only 6 of them are legal. The legal stages
		are Battlefield, Final Destination, Smashville, Town and City, Lylat Cruise, and Dreamland 64.</p>
		<h3>Legal Stages</h3>
		<ul>

		</ul>
		<h2>Competetive Community</h2>
		<p>Super Smash Bros. 4 has the second largest competetive community within all of smash, just after
		melee. This is not only because it's the newest game, but also because Nintendo decided to make Smash
		4&rsquo;s speed in the middle of Brawl&rsquo;s and Melee&rsquo;s. Therefore the game appealed to 
		previous brawl players, and previous melee players as well. The game still garners a massive fan base
		, and while not as popular as it&rsquo;s big brother melee, still rakes in the numbers; both in view
		count, and in money/sponsers.</p>
