		<h1>The Basics</h1>	
			<p id="center-p"> Smash is different from most conventional fighting games in three major ways.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The percent system</li>
				<li>The platforms</li>
				<li>Combos</li>
			</ol>
		<h2 id ="percent">The percent system</h2>
		<img src="Images/Basics.gif" width="900" height="400" alt="Gif of basic principle 
		of percent system in smash"/>
		<p> The percent system is a creative, new take on the fighting game genre. Normally in 
		a more traditional fighting game, such as street fighter, players taking damage will drain
		their health, until one player loses all of his health. However, in smash the opposite is true. 
		The more a player gets hit, the more percentage they rack up. The higher their percentage the 
		farther they get launched when hit. The goal of the game is to hit the other person out of the
		screen, or into the "blast zone". This can be upwards, sideways,downwards, or any direction in 
		between. When offstage the player attempts to "recover" by using double jumps, and various other 
		moves dependant on character. Once a player loses all their stocks (or lives), they lose. Percent
		also affects the combo game, because of how a character has different knockback the higher percent
		they are.(A characters percent can exceed 100%. Max percent is 999%).</p>
		<h2> The plaforms</h2>

		<p> Another huge difference between smash, and more conventional fighting games, are the platforms.
		Because of the difference in goals, and methods of winning, the movement options changed as well.
		a double jump was added. Jumping plays a huge role in smash, therefore plaforms were added to 
		enhance the combat experience by extending combos, and allowing for more ways to manuveur around
		an opponent.</p>
		<h2> The combos</h2>
		<img src="Images/SF.gif" width="900" height="400" alt= "Gif of street fighter true combo"/>
		<p> The last thing that seperates smash from other conventional fighting games, is the way combos
		work in this game. In most fighting games if a player is hit with a move, the follow-up is almost 
		always going to be the same. This is because once certain moves hit, certain other moves are 
		guaranteed, and create an inescapable string of moves. This is called a true combo. 
		<img src="Images/DI.gif" width="900" height="400" alt="Gif of a player getting hit with 
		the same move, but getting comboed in a different way because of Directional Influence."/>
		In smash there are no such things. This is mainly due to two things. 
		<a href="#percent">The percent system</a>, and the Directional influence system(DI for short). DI
		is a system that allows players to influence the trajectory they are launched at after a hit. This
		means that while getting the comboed, a player still has some control over where their character 
		goes. This means that combo&rsquo;s vary depending on the actions of the player getting comboed,
		and that the person comboing still has to react, and work for the combo, instead of pressing a
		pre-determined combination of buttons.</p>
